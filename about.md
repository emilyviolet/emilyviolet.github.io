Hi! My name's Emily and I'm a PhD student in theoretical physics, working on numerical and computational
techniques in atomic physics. I am co-author of the [AMBiT](https://github.com/drjuls/AMBiT) software
suite for high-precision atomic structure calculations, and ended up becoming my group's
high-performance computing specialist and all-around code witch. I'm a mostly self-taught developer;
this blog is a place to document that learning process, as well as other computer sciencey things I find
interesting.
